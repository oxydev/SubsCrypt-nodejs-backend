# What is SubsCrypt-nodejs-backend?
We provide an express-js API wrapper over the [SubsCrypt-npm-library](https://github.com/oxydev/SubsCrypt-npm-library/) to
make it easier for developers to interact with smart contract getter functions. This Rest Api can be used by other libraries to support SubsCrypt in that language (for example in [this repository](#) we made python SubsCrypt library using this Rest Api).

# How to connect?
You have to option right now, either you can run clone this project and run it on your own and also connect to a running instance of SubsCrypt smart contract( You can check the [SubsCrypt NPM package README](https://github.com/oxydev/SubsCrypt-npm-library))
